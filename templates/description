Automated Backups: This git repository has been initialized from a
template that supports automated operation as a backup.  Files that
aren't ignored will be added automatically on commit.  File metadata
will be automatically recorded on commit using gibak's ometastore or
git/contrib/hooks/setgitperms.perl if ometastore is not available.
