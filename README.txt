gitback
=======

A set of template, hooks, and simple scripts for automating the use of
git as archival backups and backing up git repositories to dumb stores
such as IMAP or Amazon S3. Implementation emphasizes unix philosophy
by building small independent pieces, stitching them together, and
integrating with existing features in git as much as possible.
